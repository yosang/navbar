# About

Practice files to keep up my front-end skills sharp.

In this one, I go deep into the art of designing navbars.

# Technology

Ive decided to use React as my front-end to be able to work with jsx rather than html as well test my application on my phone when testing it with vite. 

Ive also experimented with `react-router` in some of the applications. 

# Usage
Clone the repo with `git clone https://github.com/yosang/navbar`.

Cd into one of the appication and install dependencies with `npm install` the run it using `npm run dev`.

# Files
The final result is to be found in the `./navbar` folder, while practice files in the `./practice-files`.

To run the application locally we are using `npm run dev`.
To expose and host the application for mobile access we are using `npm run dev -- --host`.
