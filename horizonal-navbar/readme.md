Using the same principle as a with a vertical navbar, there only a few tweaks we are going to apply.

- `no-flexbox` - Using `inline-bock` on the list items.
- `flexbox` - `ul` wil function as our flexbox container and `li` will be the flexbox items. Additionally add `justify-content: space-evenly` to make a nice even gap between them. We can also go further, and style the links manually with:
    - `padding: 0.5rem 1rem` for space between the l inks
    - `display: block` to expand the clickable area of the links
