## Navbar Box model
As a general rule, we want to make sure the document itself is free of default `margins`, which by default is `8px`.
We can apply a border with `border: solid red 1px;` to the body selector.

We also want to make sure we understand the `margins` and `addings  of the underlying elements.

For debugging the box model, we can apply `borders` with different colors:

### HTML code
```html
<nav>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="#">Home</a></li>
		<li><a href="#">About</a></li>
		<li><a href="#">Shop</a></li>
		<li><a href="#">Blog</a></li>
	</ul>
</nav>
```

### CSS code
```css
body {
	border: solid red 1px;
	margin: 0;
	padding: 0;
}

nav {
	border: 5px solid blue;
}

ul {
	border: 2px solid black;
}

li {
	border: 2px dotted green;
}

a {
	background-color: yellow;
}
```

# Removing default list styling (bullets)

To remote the bullets from the `ul`, we can simply add the following style to it: `list-style-type: none`.

We also have some default space that is created by the `ul` element itself, we can remove this with `margin: 0;` and `padding: 0;`

```css
li {
	border: 2px solid black;
	margin: 0;
	padding: 0;
	list-style-type: none;
}
```

# Styling the link (color)
## Link states
We got 5 states of a link we need to understand.


- `:link` - Before you visited the site.
- `:visited` - You have clicked on this link before and visisted it.
- `:focus` - When the elemented is selected with a tag or by a clicking and hold. If te link leads nowhere, it will remain selected until we click somewhere else.
- `:hover` - Like focus, but works when the mouse hovers it.
- `:active` - After the link is clicked, before the next page actually loads.

Remember that the order here matters, due to the cascading nature of CSS.
Remember this acronym: LiVe Free HAppy for the right order.

## Text decoration
Its that little underline, it can be nice to have when hovering, but ugly otherwise.

The style is called `text-decoration`.

## Code
```css
/*LiVe Free HAppy*/
/*
:link - Before the link ever is clicked or visited before
:visited - After the link has been visited once
:focus - When selected
:hover - Mouse hover
:active - Clicked, and waiting for page to load
*/
a {
	text-decoration: none;
}

a:focus {
	background-color: yellow
}

a:visited {
	color:black;
}

a:hover {
	color: red;
}
```
